Amiga Disk Utilities
--------------------

A collection of utilities for ripping, dumping, analysing, and modifying Amiga
disk images. All code is public domain (see the COPYING file).

All code except amiga-native/ targets Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
(using Cygwin), and should be very POSIX portable.
amiga-native/ targets classic Amiga m68k, tested with SAS/C 6.50.

Prerequisites: You need at least Make and a C compiler (GCC, for Clang you'll
have to edit CC in Rules.mk). On Mac OS X, the Xcode Command Line Tools
include this. On Windows, you need Cygwin, Make, and a C compiler.

Building:
---------
    # make

Installing:
-----------
    # make install

Library search path ("error while loading shared libraries: libdisk.so.0"):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that libdisk.so will need to be on the run-time linker's search
path for many of these tools to run. There are a few ways to ensure this:
 1. Use LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X, or PATH on
 Windows. This environment variable specifies a set of paths for the linker
 to search. So, to run mfmparse without running 'make install', you could
 run it as follows:
    # LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libdisk mfmparse/mfmparse # Linux
    # DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=libdisk mfmparse/mfmparse # Mac OS X
    # PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/libdisk mfmparse/mfmparse # Cygwin
 2. Install to a location on the system-wide search path. Unfortunately
 the default install location for libdisk (/usr/local/lib64) on 64-bit
 Linux is often not searched by default. If this is the case on your system,
 you will need to add the path to /etc/ld.so.conf (or to a file in
 /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ in some Linux distros). Then try the following as root:
    # echo "/usr/local/lib64" >>/etc/ld.so.conf
    # ldconfig
 You should now be able to run mfmparse and other tools just fine.
 
 This should not be necessary on 32-bit Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X.

Brief Descriptions:
-------------------
libdisk/
    A library for converting and manipulating disk images. It can create
    disk images in a range of formats from Kryoflux STREAM and SPS/IPF images
    (among others), and then allow these to be accessed and modified.

adfbb/
    Read/modify/write ADF boot blocks. Mainly I use for stuffing bootblock
    sectors and recomputing the checksum.

adfread/
    Read file contents of an ADF and optionally dump into local host filesystem

adfwrite/
    Stuff data into selected sectors of an ADF image

amiga-native/diskread
    Dumps a disk to a (large, 20MB!) file. Really you need an
    Amiga equipped with PCMCIA-CF for this to be useful.

m68k/
  m68k/
    M68k disassembler/emulator library.
  amiga/
    Amiga emulator (very limited, sufficient to run track loaders and
    protection routines).
  disassemble
    Example utility for disassembling raw binary files
  copylock
    Run a given RNC Copylock routine in emulated environment, copying
    decrypted code to a shadow buffer for subsequent disassembly and dump

mfmparse/
    Disk file conversion tool.
    Converts From: Kryoflux STREAM, SPS/IPF, ADF, .DSK, .DFI,
                   output from Amiga diskread tool.
    Converts To: ADF, SPS/IPF, .DSK

e-uae-patches/
    A set of patches to fix and improve vanilla E-UAE-0.8.29-WIP4.
    Improvements include disk track counters and save/restore dialogs for
    the GTK-based UI, and support for reading libdisk .DSK images.

    To use these patches, create a plain e-uae-0.8.29-wip4 tree, and then,
    from within the e-uae-patches/ directory:
    # for i in `cat series`; do patch -d xxx -p1 <$i ; done
    where 'xxx' above is the path to your e-uae-0.8.29-wip4 tree!
    You can now configure/build/install e-uae as usual.
